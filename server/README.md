## OpenAi Assistant API/ Proxy

`ai.sgol.pub/v1/input/output?args`

- OpenAI is a company that offers a range of language processing and machine learning services through its API.
  You can use the request function in Node.js to make HTTP requests to the OpenAI API.
- The OpenAI API has several endpoints that you can use to perform different tasks, such as generating completions or
  making edits to text.
- You can use the apiMap object in the OpenAI class to access these endpoints and perform the corresponding tasks.
- Some parameters you might consider using when making requests to the OpenAI API include model, prompt, temperature,
  and n.
- There are several ways you can store and retrieve data in a fast, in-memory key-value store, such as using a hash map
  or object in JavaScript.
- The layout of a UI can affect productivity and it is important to consider the structure and organization of the
  content on a website.

t_to=%2Fchannels%2F974519864045756446%2F1055336272543092757Here are some of the advanced techniques in development for
anyone who doesn't check Techniques! Prompt Engineering has Evolved! Directives and Tool based chat is the future! They
can even build prompts, or just do what you want.

a DIRECTIVE is a term used to tell chat you are instructing it to do X. A list of Directives might include "write, do,
type, etc." and they are followed by : if there are extra conditions to be followed. Chat seems to read them in order,
and also follow basic logical operations such as AND OR XAND (for Not AND) and so on.

A few tips: do not make it too complex, if you write a function with too much going on it gets garbled in the
processing. Remember, GPT is a Language Model, not a program interpreter. Keep it simple, work out from the basics (
mechanics and IO style) to the more complex rules.

There is also "Multi Prompting" that is showing some promising effects with designing really complex stuff like DND
games. This works by "setting the stage" to tell chat the basics and not to start the game till we request to. Then we
feed it the rules, and request to start!

The Multi-Prompting technique also appears to work with training your session with updated info that it doesn't have.
You can use it to condense HUGE articles, YouTube transcripts, etc. You could even do something like update outdated
Python libraries (using patch notes) or so on, and even more! If using it to condense info, it probably isn't cheap so I
wouldn't abuse this if utilized for education! ask 1000 questions about the information!!

OpenAI's apiMap is an object that serves as a guide to the various endpoints available within the OpenAI API. It is
organized into a tree structure, with each level representing a part of the endpoint's URI path. For example,
v1.images.edits maps to the /v1/images/edits endpoint. Each level of the tree includes functions that correspond to HTTP
methods (such as "get" or "post") and accept relevant parameters. These functions allow users to make requests to the
OpenAI API and receive a response. The apiMap object covers a wide range of functionality, including operations related
to models, completions, edits, images, and more.

The structure of openai.apiMap is:

```json
{
  "v1": {
    "models": {
      "get": function(),
      "getModel": function(model)
    },
    "completions": {
      "post": function(body)
    },
    "edits": {
      "post": function(body)
    },
    "images": {
      "genorations": {
        "post": function(body)
      },
      "edits": {
        "post": function(body)
      },
      "variations": {
        "post": function(body)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Text completion is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that involves generating a sequence of words or a text
based on a given prompt or context. There are several ways in which text completion can be used in a profitable manner,
some examples include:

Predictive text input: Text completion can be used to improve the speed and accuracy of typing on mobile devices and
other computing platforms by suggesting words or phrases as the user types.

Natural language generation: Text completion can be used to generate natural language responses or content based on a
given context. This can be useful in a variety of applications, such as customer service chatbots or content generation
for marketing and advertising.

Summarization: Text completion can be used to generate summaries of longer texts, such as articles or reports, by
identifying the most important points and generating a shorter version of the text.

Content recommendation: Text completion can be used to recommend content or products to users based on their previous
searches or interactions.

Sentiment analysis: Text completion can be used to analyze the sentiment of text and identify whether it is positive,
negative, or neutral. This can be useful for a variety of applications, such as customer feedback analysis or market
research.
